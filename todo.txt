check lazy loading of submodules and angular 7 problems

No problems, however restriction, all navigational cases must be
with the spa path prefixed!


send in the recursion bug when mixing two angular versions in one page
- isolation and sending it in .. todo! (will ask in slack first)

https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa/issues/114

not a bug... this is heavily dependent on the framework
something in the angular applications collide
different versions might work better... but single spa itself
does nothing about the isolation. The plugin
cannot do anything because it works on unload
not double page load! So the frameworks have to isolate
themselves! Which cannot work for instance with shared globals

(check the link)



- isolation strategies....
legacy browsers ... iframe
newer browsers ... shadow dom and angular elements
as strategy on top of it

Isolation and emulated isolation works on css level
but needs adaption on the angular side:
(the master component needs an isolation flag which is part of angular)


look into other frameworks which might come along
